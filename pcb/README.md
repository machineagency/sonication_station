# Sonicator PCB

This PCB attaches on top of the Raspberry Pi enabling its GPIOs to control the Sonicator.


## Fabrication

To make this pcb, you'll need to send files (usually gerbers) out to a PCB Fab house of your choice.
Here are some options:

* [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/) will actually natively accept **.kicad\_pcb** files directly. (This is probably the easiest option.)
    * [instructions for gerber generation](https://docs.oshpark.com/design-tools/kicad/generating-kicad-gerbers/)
* [PCBWay](http://pcbway.com/)
    * [instructions for gerber generation](https://www.pcbway.com/blog/help_center/Generate_Gerber_file_from_Kicad.html)
* Bay Area Circuits has a No-Silk-No-Soldermask 24-hour [Bare Bones Special](https://bayareacircuits.com/prototype-printed-circuit-boards-pcbs/) for time crunched prototypes.
